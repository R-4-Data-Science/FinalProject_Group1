Description: This function obtains different outputs from the procedure by first obtaining
    initial values of optimization from the least-squares formula. It then allows the user
    to choose the significance level α to obtain for the 1−α confidence intervals for β. 
    The function will then provide a fitted logistic curve and the metrics of the confusion
    matrix in a grid that includes Prevalence, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, The False
    Discovery Rate, and the Diagnostic Odds Ratio.
